# Geoffrey Magana Gitau Portfolio

A clean, modern portfolio website built with pure HTML and CSS for the **July 2025 Cohort Hackathon Challenge**. This project showcases web development and design work with a focus on user experience and performance, strictly adhering to hackathon guidelines of no JavaScript, no libraries, no APIs, and no frameworks (tough, but there's a lot I could do with pure CSS).

## üèÜ Hackathon Project

This portfolio was built/developed specifically for the **July 2025 Cohort Hackathon 1 Challenge**, demonstrating:
- **Pure HTML/CSS implementation** - No JavaScript, libraries, or frameworks
- **Responsive design** - Optimized for all devices
- **Modern UI/UX** - Clean, professional design with smooth interactions

##  **Acknowledgments**

This project was quite challenging to build with pure HTML/CSS constraints, especially since I have become more proficient with TypeScript because of my range of projects. 
Still, I'm grateful for the amazing resources that helped me learn and grow:

- **Kevin Powell** on YouTube - Your CSS tutorials and responsive design guidance were invaluable
- **FreeCodeCamp** - The comprehensive web development curriculum provided the foundation for this project
- **PLP Academy Web Dev Class** - Took me back to basics and opened my eyes to some key concepts that helped build this, with the fundamentals in mind.

Thank you for making web development accessible and enjoyable!
